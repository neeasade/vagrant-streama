This is a really bad script I wrote in a hurry to throw up an instance of [streama](https://github.com/dularion/streama) on my laptop. Fun to mess with if you have vagrant and want to try it out.

The provision script is based off of: https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Setup-Streama-on-Centos-7

If you have vagrant + virtualbox you can just clone this and run `vagrant up` and then connect to http://localhost:8080/streama/
